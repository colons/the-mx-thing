Peter: Thanks. Hello. I am looking at your website with a view at potentially booking a hotel for later this year, but your website requires a title picked from a list with options such as "Mr" or "Miss". I use the title "Mx" as a gender neutral option, which is becoming more popular lately as a way of keeping gender private, and also by those who don't fit into the "male" or "female" brackets (those who consider themselves non-binary or even those transitioning between genders use this). Could I please trouble you to add "Mx" to your list of options available, or alternatively make title an optional field in your forms so it can be left blank. 
Company Rep: I would like to assure you that we have been contacted about this recently and we are currently looking into it. We obviously want to provide all of our customers with the best possible service. 
Company Rep: I'll make sure I will pass this on to relevant teams, because I agree with you, it is a very good idea. 
Peter: Thank you. That's good to hear. 
Peter: As the primary content provider for the website "The Mx Thing", I have created a record of your website on the following page: http://dontgender.me/hotels.html and I will update this if/when the Travelodge website gets updated. 
Company Rep: That's brilliant. Thank you 
Peter: I will mention our converation too (I will not mention names to protect your privacy). 
Company Rep: I appreciate that, thank you. Keep checking for updates :) 
Company Rep: Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Peter: Will do. Cheers [Company Rep]. That's all for today :D 
Company Rep: You take care now Peter :D 
Peter: You too!
